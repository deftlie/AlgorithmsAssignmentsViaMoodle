# Algorithms and Data Structures – Course Assignments

This repository contains implementations and empirical studies of classic algorithms and data structures developed as part of university coursework.
All experiments and conclusions are **based on the provided C++ source code**.

The project includes:

* Sorting algorithms and performance comparison
* Linear vs log-linear data merging
* Custom dynamic array implementation
* Multi-pivot QuickSort analysis
* Tree-based data structures (Binary, Ternary, AVL)

---


## Requirements

* **CLion** (recommended)
* **C++17** compatible compiler

  * GCC / Clang / MSVC
* CMake (bundled with CLion)

---

## Opening the Project in CLion

### 1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
```

### 2. Open CLion

* Launch **CLion**
* Click **File → Open**
* Select the **root folder** of the cloned repository
* Click **OK**

CLion will automatically detect the project structure.
